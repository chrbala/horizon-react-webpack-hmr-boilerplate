# horizon-react-webpack-hmr-boilerplate

This is an example Todo app that uses horizon-react with Webpack and hot module replacement, based on [react-transform-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate). It's meant primarily as a starting place for my own projects, so I have some configuration in this project that some may disagree with (eslint and some webpack config).
