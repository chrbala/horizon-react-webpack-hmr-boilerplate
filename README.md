# horizon-react-webpack-hmr-boilerplate

This is an example Todo app that uses horizon-react with Webpack and hot module replacement, based on [react-transform-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate). It's meant primarily as a starting place for my own projects, so I have some configuration in this project that some may disagree with (eslint and some webpack config).

## How to run
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [rethinkdb](https://www.rethinkdb.com/)
2. ``npm install``
3. Run the rethinkdb server with ``rethinkdb`` and start the web server with ``npm start``
4. Use the live app at [http://localhost:8181/](http://localhost:8181/) and admin panel at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
